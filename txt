Step 1 - DAta ingestion

Step 2 - Sanitization
    
    0 - Remove index column and fill NAs
    1 - Detect and remove outliers (messes up the training!!!!!)
    2 - Correct for skew
    3 - Replace missing data with 0

Step 3 - Transformation
    
    1 - feature engineering
    2 - drop unimportant features
    3 - Scaling

Step 4 - Define Model

    1 - Boosted trees
    2 - 3 layer NN with dropout

Step 5

    1 - Probability of defaults by decils.

Step 6

    1 - Boosted trees          - SHAP 
    2 - 3 layer NN with dropout- LIME 


QUESTIONS:

1 - Follow ipynb doc

2 - Why AUC?   (Follow ipynb)

3 - Dataset analysis (follow ipynb)

4 - Probability of defaults by decils. -> Indicates model can distiguish well between risk profiles, allowing dor customer segmentation. 

5 - XAI model (Follow ipynb)

6 - Best Score: 0.86638 ()
